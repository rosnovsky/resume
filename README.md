## Store Resume in Markdown

I love Markdown. It's resilient, cross-platform, human-readable, and just a pleasure to work with. As a job candidate, I want to be able to quickly adjust my resume to highlight specific aspects of my experience that are relevant to a particular position I apply for. Markdown makes it easy.

## Convert it to PDF

"Please provide your resume in `.md` format," said no one ever, so I've automated this part. Whenever I push an update to `resume.md`, a GitHub action springs into action and generates an updated PDF. I can send it over as a file or as a link.

## Branches

For my convenience, I can create separate branches for every version of my resume and still have a _canonical_ version available. If a particular version performs better than the others, it's easy for me to make it the canonical one.
